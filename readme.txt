# Kitchen Order Flow WebApi Challenge

This repository contains a C# solution for the Kitchen Order Flow WebApi Challenge, which involves creating a simple order routing system for a restaurant.

**Problem Statement:**

* The challenge requires building a HTTP server that receives orders and routes them to specific kitchen areas (fries, grill, salad, drink, desert).
* Orders are received via the HTTP server and placed in a queue associated with their respective destination area.

**Solution Approach:**

* **Architecture:**
    * A simple HTTP server is implemented to receive and process incoming order requests.
    * Orders are represented as simple data structures and placed in dedicated queues for each kitchen area.
    * In-memory storage is used for simplicity, but the design can be easily extended to support more robust storage options.
* **Key Features:**
    * **Concurrency Handling:** The server is designed to handle concurrent order requests efficiently.
    * **Error Handling:** Basic error handling mechanisms are implemented to gracefully handle invalid requests and unexpected situations.
    * **Code Readability:** The code is written with a focus on readability and maintainability, with clear separation of concerns.
    * **Testing:** Unit tests are included to ensure the correctness and reliability of the order routing logic.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone <repository_url>

2. **Build and run the solution:**

   **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have .NET SDK installed on your system.

   * Open the solution in Visual Studio.
   * Build the project (typically by navigating to Build -> Build Solution).
   * Run the application (usually by pressing F5 or selecting Debug -> Start Debugging).

3. **Send test orders:**

   * Use a tool like Postman or curl to send HTTP POST requests to the server's endpoint with order details. The specific endpoint URL and data format will depend on the implementation details of the solution. Refer to the code or any additional documentation for guidance.

**Further Improvements:**

* **Database Integration:** Integrate with a database for persistent storage of orders. This would allow for order history tracking, retrieval, and other functionalities beyond what's possible with in-memory storage.
* **Advanced Routing Logic:** Implement more sophisticated routing logic based on order priority, table assignments, kitchen capacity, or other relevant factors. This could involve prioritizing high-priority orders, routing orders to specific kitchens based on their contents, or handling situations where a kitchen becomes overloaded.
* **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the server for high-throughput order processing, especially if you anticipate a large volume of orders. This could involve techniques like caching, asynchronous processing, and efficient queue management.
* **Security Enhancements:** Implement security measures to protect the API from unauthorized access. This might include authentication, authorization, and data encryption mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can submit orders and that order data is protected.

**Note:**

This solution provides a basic foundation for the order routing system. It can be further extended and improved based on the specific requirements and constraints of the restaurant environment.

**Disclaimer:**

This solution is provided as a sample implementation and may not be suitable for production environments without further modifications and enhancements.
